The developed website is a discussion forum. The user can publish, comment, and react to posts, either in their own topic or in others.
Each discussion topic corresponds to a unique theme, and the user must ensure they are posting in the most suitable topic. If not, they can create their own topic.
There are three types of users: site administrators, who can delete discussion topics; topic administrators, who can delete any type of post or comment within the topic they manage; and regular users, who can delete only their own comments or posts. All users can post, like, and comment on posts.

**Feature Description:**

  - **Login:**
    The user can log in if they already have an account or click "register here," which will redirect them to the registration page.

  - **Registration:**
    The user can create an account by filling in the necessary fields: username, email, password, and date of birth.

  - **Home Page:**
    After logging in, the user enters the home page, where they can view all posts from all existing topics.
    At the top of the page, there is a button "Add Discussion Topic," wich allows the user to create a new topic by giving it a name and description. Only the topic administrator (the creator) or the site administrator can delete a topic.
    On the right (aside), there is a list of all existing topics. By clicking on one of the topics, the user can enter its respective page, where all the posts in that topic will be displayed.

  - **Topic:**
    By entering a topic, the user can view all posts within that topic, as well as like and comment on them.
    Below each post, there are three icons. The first allows the user to like the post, the second allows them to comment, and the third allows them to view all comments on that post.
    The topic administrator, when opening their own topic, can edit its title, description, and even change or delete the banner.

  - **Post:**
    The user who creates the post has the option to edit it, and they can also insert photos if desired. They can also delete their post.
    It is important to note that the user can only like a post after opening the page for that specific post.

  - **Profile:**
    By entering the profile (top right corner), the user can view their personal information and all the posts they have published, as well as log out.
